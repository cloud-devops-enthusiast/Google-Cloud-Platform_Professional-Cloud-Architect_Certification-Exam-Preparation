**Caching in Google Cloud Platform**

**What is caching?**

- This is the way to reduce the load on:
  - Your Data Stores
  - Your Servers
- How often does the data change?
  - Caching is great if the data does not change frequently.
- If you're okay with stale data?
  - Where you can specify the TTL (time to live).
- Caching Usecases:
  - Caching infrequently changing data in database
  - Caching user sessions from applications
  - Caching static content
  - Caching infrequently changing dynamic content

**MemoryStore**

- In-memory datastore service: Reduce Access times
- Fully managed (Provisioning, Replication, Failover and Patching)
  - Highly available with 99.9% availability SLA
  - Monitoring can be easily setup using Cloud Monitoring
- Support for Redis and Memcached:
  - Use Memcached for caching
    - Referance data, database query caching, session store etc
  - Use redis for low latency access with persistence and high availability
    - Gaming leader boards
- Can be accessed from:
  - Compute Engine
  - App Engine flexible and standard
  - Google Kubernetes Engine
  - Cloud Functions
- You can set the tier while creating a redis instance which can either ```Basic``` (Lower cost. Does not provide high availability) or ```Standard``` (Include a fallover replica in a seperate zone for high availability).
