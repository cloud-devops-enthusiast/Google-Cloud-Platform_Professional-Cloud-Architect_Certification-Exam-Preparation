**Compute Engine**

Virtual Machines- Virtual servers in GCP

Features-

* Create and manage the lifecycle of virtual machine (VM) instances.
* Load balancing and auto scaling for multiple VM instances.
* Attach storage & network storage to your VM instances.
* Manage network connectivity and configuration for your VM instances.

Creating VM Instance-
- Create a VM
    New VM instance: Create a new VM instance from Scratch
    New VM instance from template: Create a single VM instance from an existing template.
    New VM instance from machine image: Create a single VM intance from an existing machine image.
    Marketplace: Deploy a ready-to-go solution onto a VM instance.

- Name your VM

- Choose labels with key-value pairs, example: environment=dev, business=sales

- Choose the region and zone

- Choose the machine type
    * General-purpose (E2,N2,N2D,N1): This provides Best price-performance ratio. Machine types for commpn workloads, optimized for cost and flexibility. This is mostly suitable for Web and application servers, Small-medium databases, Dev environments, etc.

    * Memory-optimized (M2, M1): This provides ultra high memory workloads. Large-Memory machine types for memory-intensive workloads, optimized for performance. This is mostly suitable for Large in-memory databases and In-memory analytics.

    * Compute-optimized (C2): High performance machine types for compute-intensive workloads, optimized for performance. For example it can be something like gaming servers which require high CPU performance.

For Example: e2-standard-2
Where e2 is the machine family, standard is the machine series, 2 is the number of vCPUs.
One thing to mention over here is that Memory, Disk and Networking Capabilities increase along with the number of vCPUs, which means there is a scope for higher performance as compared to other machine types.

- Choose the boot disk like
    Public Images: This image is provided and maintained by Google or Open source communities or Third party vendors. Example: Debian, CentsOS, Ubuntu, Windows Server, etc.
    Custom Images: Created by you for your projects or your organzation.
    Snapshots
    Existing Disks

- Choose the Firewall Configurations: Add tags and firewall rules to allow specific network traffic from the internet.
    Allow HTTP traffic
    Allow HTTPS traffic

- Options available for VM's
    * Stop: To stop the VM instance
    * Suspend: It is like a pause to your VM
    * Reset: To restart the VM instance
    * Delete: To delete the VM instance

Practice: Compute Engine Hands-on : Setting up a HTTP Server
    #!/bin/bash
    
    sudo su // To get root access
    
    apt update // To update the packages
    
    apt install apache2 -y // To install apache2
    
    use the external IP of the VM to access the webserver

- Understanding Internal and External IP addresses v2
    * Internal IP: This is the IP address that is used to communicate with other VMs in the same project or to a corporate network. This is not accessible from the internet.
    * External IP: This is the IP address that is used to communicate with the internet. This is accessible from the internet.
    * You cannot have two resources with the same external IP address in the same project.
        * However, two different corporate networks can have resources with same internal (private) IP addresses.
    * All VM instances are assigned at least one internal IP address.
    * Creation of external IP addresses can be enabled for VM Instances.
        * **Remember** When you stop an VM instance, external IP address is lost.
    
- Getting a static IP Addresses v2 (To get a constant external IP address)
    * Go to VPC Network -> External IP Addresses -> Reserve Static Address
    * Name the Static IP Address, Choose the network service tier, Here you can choose the type of static IP address you want to reserve, like whether you want to reserve a global static IP address or a regional static IP address.
        * **Caution:** Select the same region as that of your VM (Static addresses should be in the same region as the VM instance)
    * There is an automatically assigned IP address, which is the IP address that is assigned to your VM instance when it is created, but that IP address is a an ephemeral IP address, which means that it is not a static IP address. It is a dynamic IP address that is assigned to your VM instance when it is created and it is released when you stop your VM instance.
    * Check for the change button at the end of the static IP address, Click on it and choose the Attach to drop-down menu and choose the VM instance that you want to attach the static IP address to. **Note:** If you do not see a VM listed, ensure that VM and the static address are in the same region.
    * If you assign a static IP address to a VM instance, and then you stop the VM instance, the static IP address is not released. It is still reserved and it is still associated with the VM instance. So, when you start the VM instance again, the static IP address is automatically assigned to the VM Instance.
    * **Things to Remember**
        * Static IP addresses can be switched to another VM instance in the same project.
        * Static IP remains attached even if you stop the VM instance, but you need to manually detach it.
        * **Thing to remember** You're billed for an static IP address even if it is not attached to a VM instance or you are not using it as well. Make sure you explicitly delete the static IP address when you are done with it.
    * Simplify the VM HTTP server setup: There are multiple options to setup the HTTP server.
        * Startup Script: You can choose to specify a startup script that will run when your instance boots up or restarts. Startup scripts can be used to install software and updates and to ensure that services are running within the virtual machine.
            * Bootstrapping: Install OS patches or software when an VM instance is launched.
                * In VM, you can configure Startup Script to bootstrap the VM instance.
                * For creating one go to create an instance -> Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy -> Startup Script -> Add the Startup script -> Save -> Create
        * Instance Template:
        * Custom Image 
        
Bootstraping with Startup Script        
    #!/bin/bash

    apt update

    apt -y install apache2

    echo "Hello World from $(hostname) $(hostname -I)" > /var/www/html/index.html

While accessing the webserver, you will see the default apache2 page, where you will find the default debian root is /avr/www/html with index.html file. For Customization, you can create your own index.html file and place it in the /var/www/html folder or you can change the default index.html file.
    
You can also use simple commands to replace the stuff inside the index.html file like, echo "Hello World" > /var/www/html/index.html. This will replace the default index.html file with the new one, while printing "Hello World" on the webpage instead of the default one.
