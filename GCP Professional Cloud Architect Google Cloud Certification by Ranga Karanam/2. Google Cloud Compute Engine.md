**Compute Engine**

Virtual Machines- Virtual servers in GCP

Features-

* Create and manage the lifecycle of virtual machine (VM) instances.
* Load balancing and auto scaling for multiple VM instances.
* Attach storage & network storage to your VM instances.
* Manage network connectivity and configuration for your VM instances.

Creating VM Instance-
- Create a VM
    New VM instance: Create a new VM instance from Scratch
    New VM instance from template: Create a single VM instance from an existing template.
    New VM instance from machine image: Create a single VM intance from an existing machine image.
    Marketplace: Deploy a ready-to-go solution onto a VM instance.

- Name your VM

- Choose labels with key-value pairs, example: environment=dev, business=sales

- Choose the region and zone

- Choose the machine type
    * General-purpose (E2,N2,N2D,N1): This provides Best price-performance ratio. Machine types for commpn workloads, optimized for cost and flexibility. This is mostly suitable for Web and application servers, Small-medium databases, Dev environments, etc.

    * Memory-optimized (M2, M1): This provides ultra high memory workloads. Large-Memory machine types for memory-intensive workloads, optimized for performance. This is mostly suitable for Large in-memory databases and In-memory analytics.

    * Compute-optimized (C2): High performance machine types for compute-intensive workloads, optimized for performance. For example it can be something like gaming servers which require high CPU performance.

For Example: e2-standard-2
Where e2 is the machine family, standard is the machine series, 2 is the number of vCPUs.
One thing to mention over here is that Memory, Disk and Networking Capabilities increase along with the number of vCPUs, which means there is a scope for higher performance as compared to other machine types.

- Choose the boot disk like
    Public Images: This image is provided and maintained by Google or Open source communities or Third party vendors. Example: Debian, CentsOS, Ubuntu, Windows Server, etc.
    Custom Images: Created by you for your projects or your organzation.
    Snapshots
    Existing Disks

- Choose the Firewall Configurations: Add tags and firewall rules to allow specific network traffic from the internet.
    Allow HTTP traffic
    Allow HTTPS traffic

- Options available for VM's
    * Stop: To stop the VM instance
    * Suspend: It is like a pause to your VM
    * Reset: To restart the VM instance
    * Delete: To delete the VM instance

Practice: Compute Engine Hands-on : Setting up a HTTP Server
    #!/bin/bash
    
    sudo su // To get root access
    
    apt update // To update the packages
    
    apt install apache2 -y // To install apache2
    
    use the external IP of the VM to access the webserver
    
    While accessing the webserver, you will see the default apache2 page, where you will find the default debian root is /avr/www/html with index.html file. For Customization, you can create your own index.html file and place it in the /var/www/html folder or you can change the default index.html file.
    
    You can also use simple commands to replace the stuff inside the index.html file like, echo "Hello World" > /var/www/html/index.html. This will replace the default index.html file with the new one, while printing "Hello World" on the webpage instead of the default one.
