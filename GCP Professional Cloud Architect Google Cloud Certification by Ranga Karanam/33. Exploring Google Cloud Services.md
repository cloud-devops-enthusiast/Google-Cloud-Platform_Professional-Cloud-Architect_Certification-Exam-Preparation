**Google Cloud Services**


*Cloud Scheduler*

- Fully managed, enterprise grade scheduler
  - Schedule all kinds of jobs
    - Batch, Big data jobs, cloud infrastructure operation
  - Uses Unix cron format
- Integrates with App Engine, Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Logging and any HTTP endpoint.
- Manage all your automation tasks from one place.
- Provides automated retries
- Use Case: Schedule tasks across a fleet of compute engine instances
  - Use cloud scheduler for scheduling a message on Pub/Sub
  - Compute Engine Instances can process messages from Pub/Sub
- (Remember) Needs an App Engine App in the Project
  - Earlier Alternative: App Engine Cron Service


*Cloud Emulators*

- How do you develop GCP applications in your local machine without connecting to GCP?
  - Setup local development environment with cloud emulators
- Supports emulation of:
  - Cloud BigTable
  - Cloud Datastore
  - Cloud Firestore
  - Cloud Pub Sub
  - Cloud Spanner
- You can develop your applications locally using emulators


*Cloud DNS*

- What would be the steps in setting up a website with a domain name (For example, centurix.com)
  - Step 1: Buy the domain name centurix.com (Domain Registrar)
  - Step 2: Setup your website content (Website Hosting)
  - Step 3: Route requests to centurix.com to the website host server (DNS)
- Cloud DNS = Global Domain Name System (Step 3)
  - Setup your DNS routing for your website (centurix.com)
    - Route api.centurix.com to the IP address of api server
    - Route static.centurix.com to the IP address of http server
    - Route email (admin@centurix.com) to the mail server (mail@centurix.com)
  - Public and Private managed DNS zones (Container for records)
- *CLI*
  - gcloud dns managed-zones create ZONE_NAME
    - --description (REQUIRED - Short description for the managed-zone)
    - --dns-name (REQUIRED - DNS name suffix that will be managed with the created zone)
    - --visibility (private/public)
    - --networks (List of networks that the zone be visible in if the zone visibility is [private])
  - Three Steps to add records to a managed zone:
    - Start transaction for zone
      - gcloud dns record-sets transaction start --zone
    - Make changes
      - gcloud dns record-sets transaction add --name=REC_NAME --ttl --type A/CNAME --zone=ZONE_NAME
    - End transaction for Zone


*Pricing Calculator*

- Estimating the cost if a Google Cloud Solution is not easy.
- You would need to take a number of factors into account
- How do you estimate the cost of your GCP solution ?
  - Use google Cloud pricing calculator
- Estimates for 40+ Services:
  - Compute Engine
  - Google Kubernetes Engine
  - Cloud Run
  - App Engine
  - Cloud Storage
  - etc
- (Remember) These are estimates! (Not Binding on GCP)

*REST API Changes*

- Most applications today are built around REST API:
  - Resources (/todos,/todos/{id},etc.)
  - Actions- HTTP Methods- GET, PUT, POST, DELETE etc.
- Management of REST API is not easy:
  - You've to take care of authentication and authorization
  - You've to be able to set limits (rate limiting, quotas) for your API consumers
  - You've to take care of implementing multiple versions of your API
  - You would want to implement monitoring, caching and a lot of other features
- *Apigee API Management*
- Design, Secure, Publish, Analyze, Monitor, Monetize and Scale APIs anywhere.
  - On-Premises, Google Cloud or Hybrid
- Manage complete API lifecycle
- Provides AI-powered API monitoring (Get Actionable Insights)
- Enable Caching with Cloud CDN
- Create Developer Portals:
  - Allow developers to easily explore the APIs, get API keys etc. Example: Apigee Integrated Portal
- Use Case: Abstraction layer on top of legacy services
- Use Case: Expose your assets (ML models) as APIs


*Getting Started with Identity Platform*

- Identity Platform: Customer Identity and Access Management
- What's the difference: Cloud IAM vs Identity Platform
  - Cloud IAM: Employees and Partners Authorization
    - Control Access to Google Cloud Resources
    - Member, Roles, Policy, Service Accounts
  - Identity Platform: Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM)
    - Authentication and Authorization for your Applications and Services
  - Identity Platform: Key Features
    - Authentication and Authorization for web and mobile apps (iOS, Android,...)

*Getting Started with Eventarc*

- Eventarc: Simplifies event driven architectures in Google Cloud

```
Cloud Storage       Audit Logs        ...
     |                   |             |

     |                   |             |
Cloud Function      Cloud Run         ...
```
- Microservices calling each other => Tight Coupling
- Event driven architectures: Microservices reacting to changes in state (events)
  - Example:
    - 1: Order Service publishes an OrderReceived event
    - 2: Billing Service receives it and publishes an order billed event
    - 3: Warehouse service receives it and publishes an OrderReadyToShip event
    - 4: Shipping service receives it and publishes an OrderShipped event
    - 5: Email service receives it and sets an email to the user

```
Producer 1              Producer 2
    |                       |
    -----------   -----------
              |   |

              |   |
    -----------   -----------
    |                       |
Consumer 1              Consumer 2
```

- Advantage:
  - Loose Coupling: Microservices do not know about each other
  - Flexible Orchestration: Same event can be processed by multiple services
  - Resiliency: Events can be easily retired in case of failures
  - Asynchronous: A microservice does not need to wait for the consumer to process the event.
- Cloudevents: Standard specification to describe events
  - Reference: https://cloudevents.io
  - Challenge: Different publishers use different format for events
  - Goal: Describe event data in a standard way
    - A project under CNCF- Cloud Native Computing Foundation
  - Advantages: Consistency: All events have the same structure
  - Standard Libraries and Tooling: Enables building common libraries and tooling across different types of infrastructure (AWS/Azure/Google Cloud/On-Premise/...) and languages (Python, GO, NodeJs, Java)
  - Portability: You are no longer tied to specific infrastructure or language

  *Getting started with Observability and OpenTelemetry*

  - Observability: "Measure the internal state of a system by examining its outputs.
    - Goal: Proactively identify problems and fix them
    - Three pillars of Observability: Logs, Metrics and Traces
      - Earlier we had different standards for logs, metrics and traces
      - We also had very different approaches across languages
  - How about ONE standard across platforms?
    - OpenTelemetry: Collection of technologies (tools, APIs, SDKs) to collect and export telemetry - metrics, traces and logs (https://opentelemetry.io)
      - Open Standard
      - A CNCF- Cloud Native Computing Foundation - Project (Kuberenets is another CNCF Project)
      - Almost every cloud Platform supports OpenTelemetry
      - Steps to OpenTelemetry:
        - 1: Add OpenTelemetry libraries (for your specific language) to your project
        - 2: Instrument your code to OpenTelemetry

*Using Service Directory*

```
Microservice      CustomerService       ReviewService       BookingService        FareCalculationService
      |                  |                    |                    |                        |
      V                  V                    V                    V                        V
     DB1                DB2                  DB3                  DB4                      DB5
```


- Service Directory: Help microservices find one another
- Service Directory: A single place to publish, discover and connect services
- Your workloads can be running in:
  - Google Cloud
    - (Compute Engine VMs, Google Kubernetes Engine, ...)
    - On-Prem
    - Other Clouds- AWS, Azure, ...
- Managed Service (Highly available and scalable)
- Register/Resolve services using DNS, HTTP and gRPC.
- Service directory client libraries are available for multiple languages (along with REST/RPC APIs)
  - You can use these libraries to register/resolve service location
- Audit Logging (Who did what, where, and when? - Cloud Logging)
- Request/Response Logs (Cloud Logging)
