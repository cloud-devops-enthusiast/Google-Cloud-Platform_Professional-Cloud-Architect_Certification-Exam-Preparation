**Google Cloud Services**


*Cloud Scheduler*

- Fully managed, enterprise grade scheduler
  - Schedule all kinds of jobs
    - Batch, Big data jobs, cloud infrastructure operation
  - Uses Unix cron format
- Integrates with App Engine, Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Logging and any HTTP endpoint.
- Manage all your automation tasks from one place.
- Provides automated retries
- Use Case: Schedule tasks across a fleet of compute engine instances
  - Use cloud scheduler for scheduling a message on Pub/Sub
  - Compute Engine Instances can process messages from Pub/Sub
- (Remember) Needs an App Engine App in the Project
  - Earlier Alternative: App Engine Cron Service


*Cloud Emulators*

- How do you develop GCP applications in your local machine without connecting to GCP?
  - Setup local development environment with cloud emulators
- Supports emulation of:
  - Cloud BigTable
  - Cloud Datastore
  - Cloud Firestore
  - Cloud Pub Sub
  - Cloud Spanner
- You can develop your applications locally using emulators


*Cloud DNS*

- What would be the steps in setting up a website with a domain name (For example, centurix.com)
  - Step 1: Buy the domain name centurix.com (Domain Registrar)
  - Step 2: Setup your website content (Website Hosting)
  - Step 3: Route requests to centurix.com to the website host server (DNS)
- Cloud DNS = Global Domain Name System (Step 3)
  - Setup your DNS routing for your website (centurix.com)
    - Route api.centurix.com to the IP address of api server
    - Route static.centurix.com to the IP address of http server
    - Route email (admin@centurix.com) to the mail server (mail@centurix.com)
  - Public and Private managed DNS zones (Container for records)
- *CLI*
  - gcloud dns managed-zones create ZONE_NAME
    - --description (REQUIRED - Short description for the managed-zone)
    - --dns-name (REQUIRED - DNS name suffix that will be managed with the created zone)
    - --visibility (private/public)
    - --networks (List of networks that the zone be visible in if the zone visibility is [private])
  - Three Steps to add records to a managed zone:
    - Start transaction for zone
      - gcloud dns record-sets transaction start --zone
    - Make changes
      - gcloud dns record-sets transaction add --name=REC_NAME --ttl --type A/CNAME --zone=ZONE_NAME
    - End transaction for Zone


*Pricing Calculator*

- Estimating the cost if a Google Cloud Solution is not easy.
- You would need to take a number of factors into account
- How do you estimate the cost of your GCP solution ?
  - Use google Cloud pricing calculator
- Estimates for 40+ Services:
  - Compute Engine
  - Google Kubernetes Engine
  - Cloud Run
  - App Engine
  - Cloud Storage
  - etc
- (Remember) These are estimates! (Not Binding on GCP)


*Anthos*

- Run K8s clusters on cloud and on-premises
  - Multi-cluster management: Consistent managed K8s
  - Consistent development and operations experience
- Centralized config management (Git Repo)
  - Logically group and normalize clusters as environs
    - Define policies - Kuberenetes API, Access Control
  - Deploy to clusters on new commits
    - Use Namespaces, labels, and annotations to decide which clusters to apply changes on
- Provides Service Mesh (based on Istio)
  - Sidecar to implement common microservices features
    - Authentication and Authorization (Service Accounts)
    - Distributed Tracing, Automatic Metrics, Logs & Dashboards
    - A/B Testing, Canary Rollouts (Even track SLIs and Error Budgets)
    - Cloud Logging & Cloud Monitoring Support

*REST API Changes*

- Most applications today are built around REST API:
  - Resources (/todos,/todos/{id},etc.)
  - Actions- HTTP Methods- GET, PUT, POST, DELETE etc.
- Management of REST API is not easy:
  - You've to take care of authentication and authorization
  - You've to be able to set limits (rate limiting, quotas) for your API consumers
  - You've to take care of implementing multiple versions of your API
  - You would want to implement monitoring, caching and a lot of other features
