**Agile, DevOps, SRE and SDLC**

**Software development life cycle (SDLC)- Waterfall**

- Software development in multiple long phases:
```
Requirements -->> Design -->> Implementation -->> Testing -->> Deployment
```

- Feedback loop is very slow in this model and the documentation gets up with not much use at the end.

**Software development life cycle (SDLC)- Spiral**

- Software development in smaller iterations:
  - Start
  - Iteration 1
  - Iteration 2
  - ...
```
Vision -->> Iteration -->> Iteration -->> ... -->> Iteration n -->> Product
```
- This model consists of multiple iterartions which consists of smaller tasks which can be completed quickly and as feedback is very important the feedback response becomes fast.

**Software development life cycle (SDLC)- Agile**

- Principles:
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
  - Here you focus more on software over comprehensive documentation.
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
  - Responding to change over following a plan.
  - Now there are 12 principles (https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
  - The development is done in multiple sprints which makes the whole process more transparent and tracking easy.
  - The sprint consists of mostly 3-4 phases, which ranges from 1-4 weeks, where at end of every sprint we demo to the business.
- But add a bit of rigidity from waterfall model for critical safety software like Flight navigation software, Medical devices software etc).

```
Plan -->> Code -->> Build -->> Test --> Release -->> Deploy -->> Review
```

**What is DevOps**

```
Business -->> Development -->> Operations
```

- Getting better at "Three elements of Great software teams"
  - Communication- Get teams together.
  - Feedback- Earlier you find a problem, easier it is to fix.
  - Automation- Automate testing, infrastructure provisioning, deployment and monitoring.

**DevOps- CI-CD**

```
Code Commit -->> Unit tests -->> Integration Tests -->> Package -->> Deploy -->> Automation tests -->> Testing Approval -->> Deploy Next -->> ...
```

- Continuous Integration
  - Continuously run your tests and packaging
  - It is like as you commit the code you can run the tests and create a deployment package like .jar or .war or for docker image you need to make a docker image and you can deploy it to the production.
- Continyous Deployment
  - Continuously deploy to test environment
  - Addition to the above thing you need to deploy your code to some test environments where you can run the tests and see how the things are working. These tests can be either manual or automatic testing environments.
- Continuous Delivery
  - Continuously deploy to production
  - Here you deploy the code to production while working on the new features or bug fixes. Also you make multiple releases to the dev environment.
  - At some places there is a step of *Testing approval* which opts for approval for certain kind of feature roll-outs.

- Recommended Things to do:

- Static Code Analysis
  - Lint, Sonar
  - Including Static Security Checks (Source code Security Analyzer software like Veracode or Static code analyzer)
- Runtime Checks
  - Run Vulnerability Scanners (Automated tools that scan web applications for security vulnerabilities)
- Tests
  - Unit tests (JUnit, pytest, Jasmine etc)
  - Integration tests (Selenium, Robot Framework, Cucumber etc)
  - System Tests (Selenium, Robot Framework, Cucumber etc)
  - Sanity and Regression tests
