**Understanding Data States**

- *Encryption*: When we move our data from one place to another, we need to encrypt it to protect it from unauthorized access.
- Data at Rest: Stored on a device or a backup.
  - Examples: Data on a hard disk, in a database, backups and archives.
- Data in Motion: Being transferred across a network. (also said as Data in Transit)
  - Examples: Data copied from on-premise to cloud storage or An application talking to a database.
  - Two types:
    - In and out of cloud (from internet): You can have secuurity at a lower level as compared within the cloud data transfers.
    - within cloud (from one service to another): You can control over the whole data transfer process.
- Data in Use: Active data processed in a non-persistent state.
  - Example: Data in your memory.
