**Private Network with Cloud VPC**

**Need for Google Cloud VPC**

- In a corporate network or an on-prem data center as no one can see the data exchange between the application and the database.
- No one can directly connect to your database from the internet.
- You need to connect your corporate network and then access your applications or databases.
- At a short, you can say "Corporate Network provides a secure internal network protecting your resources, data and communication from external users.

**Google Cloud VPC**

- Google Cloud VPC is your own isolated network in GCP Cloud.
  - Network traffic within a VPC is isolated (not visible) from all other Google Cloud VPC's.
- You control all the traffic coming in and going outside a VPC
- (Best Practice) Create all your GCP resources (Compute, storage, databases, etc) within a VPC.
  - Secure resources from unauthorized access AND
  - Enable secure communication between your cloud resources.
- VPC is a global resource and contains subnets in one or more regions.
  - (Remember) VPC is not tied to a region or zone. VPC resources can be in any region or zone.

**Need for VPC subnets**

- Different types of resources are created on cloud - databases, compute, etc.
  - Each type of resource has its own access needs.
  - Load balancers are accessible from internet (public resources)
  - Databases or VM instances should not be accessible from internet
    - Only applications within your network (VPC) should be able to access them (private resources).
- To seperate public resources from the private resources inside a VPC, you need to create seperate Subnets.
- (Additional Reason) You want to distribute resources across multiple regions for the high availability.

**VPC Subnets**

- (As Solution) Create different subnets for public and private resources.
  - Resources in a public subnet CAN be accessed from the internet.
  - Resources in a private subnet CANNOT be accessed from the internet.
  - But resources in public subnet can talk to resources in private subnet.
- Each subnet is created in a region.
- Example: VPC - demo-vpc => Subnets - region us-central1, europe-west1 or us-west1 or ...

**Creating VPC's and Subnets**

- By default, every project has a default VPC.
- You can create YOUR own VPC's:
  - Option 1: Auto mode VPC network
    - Subnets are automatically created in each region.
    - Default VPC is created automatically in the project uses auto mode VPC network.
  - Option 2: Custom mode VPC network:
    - No subnets are automatically created.
    - You have complete control over subnets and their IP ranges.
    - Recommended for production environments.
  - Options when you create a subnet:
    - Enable *Private Google Access*- Allows VM's to connect to Google API's using private IP addresses.
    - Enable *Flow Logs* - To troubleshoot any VPC related network issues.

**CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) Blocks**

- Resources in a network use continuous IP addresses to make routing easy:
  - Example: Resources inside a specific network can use IP addresses from 69.208.0.0 to 69.208.0.15
- A *CIDR BLOCK* consists of starting IP address (69.208.0.0) and a range (/28)
  - Example: CIDR block 69.208.0.0/28 represents addresses from 69.208.0.0 to 69.208.0.15- a total of 16 addresses.
- Quick Tip: 69.208.0.0/28 indicates that the first 28 bits (out of 32) are fixed.
  - Last 4 bit can change => 2 to the power of 4 = 16 addresses.

- How many addresses does 69.208.0.0/26 represent?
  - 2 to the power of (32-36)=6 = 64 addresses (69.208.0.0/0 to 69.208.0.0/63).
- How many addresses does 69.208.0.0/30 represent?
  - 2 to the power of (32-30)=2 = 4 addresses (69.208.0.0/0 to 69.208.0.0/3).
- How many difference between 0.0.0.0/0 and 0.0.0.0/32?
  - 0.0.0.0/0 Represent all IP addresses. 0.0.0.0/32 represents a single IP address.

**VPC Network**

- Name a VPC network
- Subnets: Subnets let you create your own private cloud topology within the google cloud
- There are two subnet creation mode: Custom and Automatic
- Here you need to Name the subnet, select the region, select the IP range, and select the subnet mode.
- Check for private google access and flow logs (Turning on VPC flows doesn't affect performance, but some systems generate a large number of logs, which can increase costs in stackdriver).
- You need to configure the firewall rules to allow the traffic to flow between the subnets. Here are some pre-configured firewall rules for the subnets and you can define more in case you need more. Once the vpc is created, you can add more subnets and firewall rules as well from the firewall rules section.
- You cam also choose between the regional (Cloud routers will learn routes only in region in which they are created) and global dynamic routing modes (Global routing mode lets you dynamically learn routes to and from all regions with a single VPN or interconnect or Cloud Router).
- For assigning the VPC to the resources, you need to select the VPC network and the subnet from the dropdown list.

**Firewall Rules**

- Configure the firewall rules to allow the traffic going in or out of the network:
  - Stateful
  - Each firewall rule has a priority (0-65535) assigned to it.
  - 0 has highest priority and 65535 has lowest priority.
  - Default implied rule with lowest priority (65535).
    - It allows all egress traffic and denies all ingress traffic.
    - Default rules can't be deleted
    - You can override the default rules by creating a new rule with higher priority or with priority 0-65534.
  - Default VPC has 4 additional rules with priority 65534.
    - Allow incoming traffic from the VM instances in same network (default-allow-internal)
    - Allow incoming TCP traffic from anywhere on port 22(SSH) (default-allow-ssh)
    - Allow incoming TCP traffic from anywhere on port 3389(RDP) (default-allow-rdp)
    - Allow incoming ICMP traffic from anywhere (default-allow-icmp)

- *Firewall Rules: Ingress and Egress Rules*:
  - Ingress Rules: Incoming traffic from outside to GCP targets.
    - Target (Defines the destination): All instances or instances with TAG/SA
    - Source (Defines where the traffic is coming from): CIDR or all instances/instances with TAG/SA
  - Egress Rules: Outgoing traffic to destination from GCP targets.
    - Target (Defines the source): All instances or instances with TAG/SA
    - Destination: CIDR Block
  - Along with each rule, you can also define:
    - Priority- Lower the number, higher the priority.
    - Action on match- Allow or Deny traffic.
    - Protocol- ex. TCP or UDP or ICMP
    - Port- Which port?
    - Enforcement Status-- Enable or Disable the rule.

**Firewall rules: Best Practices**

- You can add tags to your instances to make it easier to create firewall rules. For example, you can create a tag called "disable-http" and add it to all your web servers. Then you can create a firewall rule to allow traffic to all web servers. where you can select the tag "disable-http" as the target in the firewall rule. Choose allow on match and specify the protocol and ports as TCP and port as 80. This will allow all the web servers to receive traffic on port 80.
- Use network traffic and control allowed traffic into a VM using firewall rules.
- Ensure that firewall rule allow the right kind of traffic to the right kind of resources.
  - Only allow the traffic from load balancing into VM instances.
  - Remove 0.0.0.0/0 from the source IP range as it allows all traffic from anywhere.
    - Add 130.211.0.0/22 and 35.191.0.0/16 as these are the cloud load balancing IP ranges.
    - If you allow these ip ranges only, you can see it allows the health check from load balancing to VM instances.
- (Remember) all egress from an VM instance is allowed by default.
  - To allow specific egress only
    1. Create an egress rule with low priority to deny all the traffic.
    2. Create an egress rule with high priority to allow the traffic on specific port.

**Shared VPC**

- Scenario: Your organization has multiple projects and you want resources in one project to be able to communicate with resources in another project.
  - To allow resources in different projects to talk with internal IP addresses, securely and efficiently.
- Here comes the shared VPC.
  - Created at an organization or shared folder level. (Access needed: Shared VPC Admin)
  - Allows VPC network to be shared between projects in same organization.
  - Shared VPC contains one host project and multiple service projects.
    - Host project: The project that contains the shared VPC network.
    - Service project: The project that uses the shared VPC network or Attached to host project.
- This helps you to achieve separation of concerns:
  - Network Administrators resposible for host projects and resource users use service projects.

**VPC Peering**

- Scenario: How to connect VPC networks across different organizations
- Here comes the VPC Peering.
  - Network in same project, different projects and across projects in different organizations can be peered.
  - All communication between the peered VPC happens using the internal IP addresses.
    - This is highly efficient because all communication happens within the google cloud network and secure because it is not accessible from the internet.
    - No data transfer charges for data transferred between services because all communication you make here is internal.
  - (Remember) Network administration is not changed at all
    - Admin of one VPC do not get the role automatically in a peered network.

NOTES:

- Enabling private google access would enable on a subnet to allow VM's in a subnet to connect to Google APIs using private IP addresses.
- As i want to make use of the default firewall rules, We want to only allow HTTPS outbound calls from our VM instances so as you want to disable all other outbound traffic. So i will create an egress rule with the priority 65000 to deny all the traffic and Create an egress rule with the priority 1000 to allow the HTTPS traffic on port 443.
- As you have an organization with multiple projects and you want to allow resources in multiple projects to talk with internal IPs securely and efficiently. So you can use the shared VPC.
- As you want to enable secure communication between two different VPC networks belonging to different organizations. So you can use the VPC peering over here.
