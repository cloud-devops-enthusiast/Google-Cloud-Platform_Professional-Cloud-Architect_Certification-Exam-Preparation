**Release Management In Google Cloud**

**1: Release Management**

```
                         V2                  
                         |                   
                         |                   
                         V2                  
                         |                    
                         |                   
                         V2                  
     

     V1                  V1                  V2
     |                   |                   |
     |                   |                   |
     V1                  V1                  V2
     |                   |                   |
     |                   |                   |
     V1                  V1                  V2
```

- Goals: Very from app to app
  - Zero Downtime
  - Only one version live at a time
  - Minimize costs (and infrastructure needed)
  - Test with production traffic before going live
- Best Practices:
  - Small Incremental Changes
  - Automation (as much as possible)

**2: Deployment Approach: Recreate**

```
     V1                 V2
     |                  |
     |                  |
     V1                 V2
     |                  |
     |                  |
     V1                 V2
Step 1 [Start]          Step 2 [End]
```

- Approach:
  - Terminate Version 1
  - Roll out Version 2
- Characteristics:
  - App down during the release
  - Rollback needs redeployment
    - And more downtime
  - Cost effective and Fast
    - But disruptive
  - Avoid need for backward compatibility (data and applications)

**3: Deployment Approach: Canary and A/B Testing**

```
     V1                  V1                  V2
     |                   |                   |
     |                   |                   |
     V1                  V1                  V2
     |                   |                   |
     |                   |                   |
     V1                  V1                  V2
     |                   |                   |
     |                   |                   |
     V1                  V2                  V2
     |                   |                   |
     |                   |                   |
     V1                  V2                  V2
```
*Canary*

- Approach:
  - Step 1: V2 rolled out to a subset of instances
  - Step 2: On Successful testing, V2 rolled out to all instances
    - OR V2 is rolled back in case of failure
- Characteristics:
  - Fast
  - Zero downtime
  - No extra infrastructure
  - Minimizes impact to users (in case of release failures)
  - Needs backward compatibility (data and applications)

*A/B Testing*

- Use Case: You want to see if users like a specific feature
- Approach:
  - Step 1: V2 (with new feature) rolled out to a subset of users
  - Step 2: On Sucessfull testing, V2 rolled out to all users
    - OR we go back to V1 in case users don't like the feature
- Characteristics:
  - Gives the ability to test if your users like a feature

**4: Deployment Approach: Rolling and Rolling with Additional Batch**

*Deployment Approach: Rolling*

```
     V1                 V1                  V2                 V1
     |                  |                   |                  |
     |                  |                   |                  |
     V1                 V1                  V1                 V1
     |                  |                   |                  |
     |                  |                   |                  |
     V1                 V1                  V1                 V2
     |                  |                   |                  |
     |                  |                   |                  |
     V1                 V1                  V2                 V2
     |                  |                   |                  |
     |                  |                   |                  |
     V1                 V2                  V2                 V2
```

- Approach:
  - Step 1: V2 rolled out to a percentage of instances (Example Window Size:5%)
  - Step 2: V2 gradually rolled out to rest of the instances (Example: 5% at a time)
- Characteristics:
  - Slow
  - Zero Downtime
  - Needs automation and additional setup
  - No extra infrastructure
  - Minimizes impact to users (in case of release failures)
  - Needs backward compatibility (data and applications)

*Deployment Approach: Rolling with Additional Batch*

```
     V1                 V1                  V2                 V1
     |                  |                   |                  |
     |                  |                   |                  |
     V1                 V1                  V1                 V1
     |                  |                   |                  |
     |                  |                   |                  |
     V1                 V1                  V1                 V2
     |                  |                   |                  |
     |                  |                   |                  |
     V1                 V1                  V2                 V2
                        |                   |                  |
                        |                   |                  |
                        V2                  V2                 V2
```
- Approach:
  - Step 1: Additional batch of new instances are created with V2 (Example: 5%)
  - Step 2..N: V2 gradually rolled out to the instances batch by batch (Example: 5% at a time)
- Characteristics:
  - Same as Rolling Deployment except for:
    - Needs Little bit of extra infrastructure
    - ZERO reduction in number of instances handling user requests

**5: Deployment Approach: Blue Green and Shadow Testing**

*Deployment Approach: Blue Green*

```
                         V2                  
                         |                   
                         |                   
                         V2                  
                         |                    
                         |                   
                         V2                  
     

     V1                  V1                  V2
     |                   |                   |
     |                   |                   |
     V1                  V1                  V2
     |                   |                   |
     |                   |                   |
     V1                  V1                  V2
Step 1 [Start]     Step 2 [Middle]      Step 3 [End]
```

- Approach: 
  - Step 1: V1 is live
  - Step 2: Create (or replicate) a parallel environment with V2
  - Step 3: Switch all traffic from V1 to V2 (and remove V1 Environment)
- Characteristics:
  - Instant
  - Zero Downtime
  - Easy Rollback
  - Needs additional infra (during the release)
  - Zero reduction in available capacity
  - Needs backward compatibility (data and apps)

*Deployment Approach: Shadow*

- Approach:
  - Step 1: V1 is live
  - Step 2: Create (or replicate) a parallel environment with V2
    - Mirror traffic to V1 and V2
  - Step 3: Switch all traffic from V1 to V2 (and remove V1 Environment)
- Characteristics:
  - Zero production impact: Test V2 with real production traffic before releasing
    - You can also capture and replay live production traffic
  - Complicated: It is complicated, You don't want to double the payments (might need stubbing)
