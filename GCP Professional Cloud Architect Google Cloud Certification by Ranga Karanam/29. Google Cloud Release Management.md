**Release Management In Google Cloud**

**Step 1: Release Management**

- Goals: Very from app to app
  - Zero Downtime
  - Only one version live at a time
  - Minimize costs (and infrastructure needed)
  - Test with production traffic before going live
- Best Practices:
  - Small Incremental Changes
  - Automation (as much as possible)

**Step 2: Deployment Approach: Recreate**

```
     V1                     V2
     |                      |
     |                      |
     V1                     V2
     |                      |
     |                      |
     V1                     V2
Step 1 [Start]          Step 2 [End]
```

- Approach:
  - Terminate Version 1
  - Roll out Version 2
- Characteristics:
  - App down during the release
  - Rollback needs redeployment
    - And more downtime
  - Cost effective and Fast
    - But disruptive
  - Avoid need for backward compatibility (data and applications)

**Step 3: Deployment Approach: Canary**

```
     V1                     V1                  V2
     |                      |                   |
     |                      |                   |
     V1                     V1                  V2
     |                      |                   |
     |                      |                   |
     V1                     V1                  V2
     |                      |                   |
     |                      |                   |
     V1                     V2                  V2
     |                      |                   |
     |                      |                   |
     V1                     V2                  V2
```

- Approach:
  - Step 1: V2 rolled out to a subset of instances
  - Step 2: On Successful testing, V2 rolled out to all instances
    - OR V2 is rolled back in case of failure
- Characteristics:
  - Fast
  - Zero downtime
  - No extra infrastructure
  - Minimizes impact to users (in case of release failures)
