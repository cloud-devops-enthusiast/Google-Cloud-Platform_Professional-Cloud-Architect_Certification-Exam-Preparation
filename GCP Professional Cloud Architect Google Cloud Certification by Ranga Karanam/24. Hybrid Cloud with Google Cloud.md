**Hybrid Cloud with Google Cloud**

- **Cloud VPN**

- Used to connect on premise to GCP network over internet.
  - This is implemented using IPSec VPN Tunnel.
  - Traffic through internet (public)
  - The traffic going through VPN is encrypted using Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol(IKEv1 or IKEv2).
- There are two types of Cloud VPN Solutions:
  - HA VPN (SLA of 99% service availability with two external IP addresses)
    - Only dynamic routing (BGP) Supported
  - Classic VPN (SLA of 99.99% service availability, a single external IP address)
    - This supports static routing (policy-based, route-based) and dynamic routing using (BGP)
- As they are easy to establish: This does not need carrier circuits or contracts.
- Cloud VPN is only recommended if:
  - You want the network to encrypt traffic OR
  - You want a lower throughput, low cost solution OR
  - You are experimenting with connectivity between cloud and on-premises.
- High availability VPN gives you with two external IP addresses and two gateway interfaces.
  - Needs a Cloud HA VPN Gateway.
  - High availability (99.99% SLA, within region)
    - Regional resources with two interfaces
    - Connects to an on-premises VPN gateway (or peer gateway) through VPN tunnels.
- Else in Classic VPN you get a single external IP address and a single gateway interface over a single tunnel.
  - No high availability
  - Needs a Google Compute engine gateway
- Always remember VPN gateway is a regional resource.
- (Remember) Cloud Router enables dynamic routing: Enable Automatic route update when network topology changes.

- **Cloud Interconnect**

- Cloud Interconnect is a high speed, highly available, low latency private connection into google cloud from your on-premises network. Interconnect lets you establish high bandwidth, low latency connections between your Google cloud VPC networks and your on-premises infrastructure.
- Dedicated Interconnect: Connect your on-premises network to google cloud VPC network by connecting a new fiber to your equipment.
  - Ideal if you need high bandwidth connection for large data transfer.
  - Minimum private connection speed of 10 Gbps (Options: 10 Gbps or 100 Gbps)
    - Go upto 8 * 10 Gbps (80 Gbps) or 2 * 100 Gbps (200 Gbps) circuits for each connection.
  - Takes time to establish
- Partner interconnect: Connect your on-premises network to your google cloud VPC network through a connection from a supported service provider.
  - Ideal if you need a private connection with lower bandwidth needs
  - 50 Mbps to 10 Gbps
- Data exchange happens through a private network:
  - Communicate using VPC networks internal IP addresses from on-premises network.
  - Reduce egress costs
  - As public internet is not used.

**Hybrid Connectivity**

- When you connect networks, ensure that resources on the networks use different range of IP addresses.
- Always Think: What will we do if things go wrong?
  - Have a fallback option if the primary connection from on-premises to GCP fails.
    - Dedicated interconnect as primary
    - VPN as backup in case of failure.
- Remember that there is a third hybrid connectivity option:
  - Direct Peering: Connect Customer network to google network using network peering
    - Direct path from on-premises network to google services
    - Not a GCP Service
      - Lower level network connection outside of GCP
    - NOT Recommended
      - Use Cloud Interconnect and Cloud VPN

**Notes**

- Cloud VPN can be used to connect on-premise network to GCP network over internet.
- Cloud Interconnect is a high-speed (more than 10 Gbps), highly available, low latency private connection into google cloud from your on-premises network.
- Cloud Router enables dynamic routing (Automatic route update when network topology changes) for your cloud VPN Connections.
