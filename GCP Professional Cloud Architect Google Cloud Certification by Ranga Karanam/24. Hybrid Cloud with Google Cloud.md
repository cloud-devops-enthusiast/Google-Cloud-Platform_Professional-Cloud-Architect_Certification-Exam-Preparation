**Hybrid Cloud with Google Cloud**

- **Cloud VPN**

- Used to connect on premise to GCP network over internet.
  - This is implemented using IPSec VPN Tunnel.
  - Traffic through internet (public)
  - The traffic going through VPN is encrypted using Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol.
- There are two types of Cloud VPN Solutions:
  - HA VPN (SLA of 99% service availability with two external IP addresses)
    - Only dynamic routing (BGP) Supported
  - Classic VPN (SLA of 99.99% service availability, a single external IP address)
    - This supports static routing (policy-based, route-based) and dynamic routing using (BGP)
- As they are easy to establish: This does not need carrier circuits or contracts.
- Cloud VPN is only recommended if:
  - You want the network to encrypt traffic OR
  - You want a lower throughput, low cost solution OR
  - You are experimenting with connectivity between cloud and on-premises
