**Compute Engine and Load Balancing for Architects**

- Availability
  - This is the percentage of time an application provides the operations expected out of it.
    - Example: 99.99% availability. Also called four 9's availability.
  - Availability is more about the applications availability when users need them.
    - Availability of 99.95% comes with roughly 22 minutes of downtime in a month.
    - Availability of 99.99% comes with roughly 4 and half minutes of downtime in a month. This is about the most online applications aim for 99.99%(four 9's) availability.
    - Availability of 99.999% comes with just 26 seconds of downtime in a month. Where achieving 5.9's availability is very difficult.

- High Availability Architecture for compute engine and Load balancing
  - Multiple regional instance groups for each microservice.
  - Distribute load using a global HTTP(S) load balancer.
  - Configure health checks for instacne group and load balancing. (Providing ease to replace)
  - Enable live migration for VM instances.
  - Advantages:
    - Instances distributed across multiple regions. (You can have better fault tolerance like if your one zone region goes down, you can still have your application running in another region.)
    - Global load balancing is highly available.
    - Health checks ensure that only healthy instances are added to the load balancer and replacing with healthy instance when needed.

- Scalability
