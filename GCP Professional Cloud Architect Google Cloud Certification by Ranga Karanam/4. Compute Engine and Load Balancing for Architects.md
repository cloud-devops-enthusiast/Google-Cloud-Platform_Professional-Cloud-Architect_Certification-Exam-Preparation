**Compute Engine and Load Balancing for Architects**

- Availability
  - This is the percentage of time an application provides the operations expected out of it.
    - Example: 99.99% availability. Also called four 9's availability.
  - Availability is more about the applications availability when users need them.
    - Availability of 99.95% comes with roughly 22 minutes of downtime in a month.
    - Availability of 99.99% comes with roughly 4 and half minutes of downtime in a month. This is about the most online applications aim for 99.99%(four 9's) availability.
    - Availability of 99.999% comes with just 26 seconds of downtime in a month. Where achieving 5.9's availability is very difficult.

- High Availability Architecture for compute engine and Load balancing
  - Multiple regional instance groups for each microservice.
  - Distribute load using a global HTTP(S) load balancer.
  - Configure health checks for instacne group and load balancing. (Providing ease to replace)
  - Enable live migration for VM instances.
  - Advantages:
    - Instances distributed across multiple regions. (You can have better fault tolerance like if your one zone region goes down, you can still have your application running in another region.)
    - Global load balancing is highly available.
    - Health checks ensure that only healthy instances are added to the load balancer and replacing with healthy instance when needed.

- Scalability
  - Can we handle a growth in users, traffic, or data size without any drop in performance?
  - Does ability to serve more growth increase the popularity with resources? Like there is a sudden increase to some application and it is required to scale up.
  - Ability to adapt to changes in demand(based on users and data).
  - What can be the options for doing so,
    - You can deploy to a bigger instance with bigger CPU and more amount of memory.
    - You can also increase the number of application instances and setup a load balancer.

- **Vertical Scaling** (Increasing the size of the instance)
  - Vertical scaling is the process in which we deploy application/database to a bigger instance where it can be A larger hard drive, A faster CPU, or more memory or networking capabilities.
  - There are certain limits to the Vertical Scaling, there is a limit to how much CPU can you have.

- **Horizontal Scaling** (Increasing the number of instances)
  - Deploying multiple instances of application/database, here instead of having single database you can distribute the data across multiple servers.
  - Typically, Horizontal scaling is preferred to Vertical scaling.
    - Vertical Scaling has limits.
    - Vertical Scaling can be expensive.
    - Horizontal Scaling increases availability.
  - (As of) Horizontal scaling needs additional infrastructure: load balancers, etc.
