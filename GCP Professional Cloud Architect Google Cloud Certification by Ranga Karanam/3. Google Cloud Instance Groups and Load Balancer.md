**Instance Groups**
- An Instance template is a group of VM instances managed as a single entity. Manage group of similar VM's having similar lifecycle as one unit.
There are majorly two types of Instance Groups:
1. Managed Instance Groups(MIG): Identical VMs created using an Instance template (As it is mandatory to use Instance Template over here).
    * *Features*: 
        - Auto Scaling (Increase and decrease instances based on the load): Configure auto-scaling to automatically adjust the number of instances based on the load. Here you need to define the minimum and maximum number of instances that can be created inside the MIGs. As moving forward you need to define the autoscaling metrics, where you need to define the CPU Utilization target or Load balancer Utilization target or Any other metric from the stackdriver, here in these metrics you can define the *Cool Down Period* (How long to wait before looking at auto scaling metrics again?) or the *Scale In Controls* (Preventing a sudden drop in number of VM Instances).
        - Auto Healing (Detect application failures using health checks and replace unhealthy instances)
        - Managed Releases 
            - Rolling Updates: (Release new version step by step (graudually) to avoid downtime, Update a percentage of instances to the new version at a time)
            - Canary Deployment: Test new version with a group of instances before releasing it across all instances.
        - Maintain Certain number of VMs: If an instance crashes, MIG launches another instance to replace it.
        - Create instances in multiple zones (regional MIGs) (These regional MIGs provide higher availability compared to zonal MIGs)
2. Unmanaged Instance Groups: VMs with different configuration(VMs with different images used to create, VMs with different hardware) while staying in the same group.
    * *Features*:
        - No Auto Scaling
        - No Auto Healing
        - and other features of Managed Instance Groups
        - Not recommended: unless you need different kinds of VMs in the same group.
*Location* for the Instance Groups can either be Zonal or Regional. Regional gives you higher availability(**Recommended**).
