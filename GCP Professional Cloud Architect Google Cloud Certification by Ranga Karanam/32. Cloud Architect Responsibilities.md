**Cloud Architect Responsibilities**

*Architect: Understand Business Requirements*

- Business Requirements: Define what your business needs
- Example of Business Requiremenets:
  - Reduce costs (Understand Capital Expenditure vs Operational Expenditure)
    - Managed Services
    - Autoscaling
    - Premptible VMs: If you need time bound workloads
  - Increase pace of innovation
    - Evaluate and adopt emerging processes like DevOps (CI/CD) and SRE
    - Evaluate and adopt emerging architectures like microservices
  - Reduce mean time to recovery
  - Improve compliance with regulations
  - More visibility into applications and infrastructure (metrics)
  - More intelligence from the available data

*Architect: KPI for Business Requirements*

- How can you measure if you are meeting business objectives?
- Define KPIs (Key Performance Indicator) where possible:
  - How is the business doing with respect to an objective?
  - Project KPIs:
    - Example: Number of new customers in a week
    - Example: Percentage of virtual machines running in the cloud
  - Operational KPIs
    - Example: Operational cost per customer

*Total Cost of Ownership (TCP)*

- Total cost of ownership (TCO) includes:
  - Licensing Costs (Software + Hardware)
  - Computing Costs
  - Storage Costs
  - Networking Costs (Connection Cost + Data Ingress + Data Egress)
  - Personal Costs (Dev + Test + Ops + Business + ...)
  - Other Costs
    - Penalties for missed SLAs or Compliance needs
    - Third party APIs
    - ...

*Defining Technical Requirements*

- Technical aspects that your system must adhere to
  - Functional:
    - Must use Containers
    - Must use hardened Linux OS
    - Needs container orchestration
    - Must be autoscaling
    - Must be No-SQL database with flexible schema
    - Able to store huge volumes of archives at very low cost
    - Must use a private network (traffic should not go over internet)
  - Non Functional:
    - Availability
    - Scalability
    - Durability
    - Security

*Planning for High Availabilty*

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Geographical Distribution</td>
<td>Availablity: Global > Multi-Regional > Regional > Zonal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Compute Engine</td>
<td>Live Migration

Managed Instance Groups with Autoscaling and Health Checks (Auto Healing)

Distribute Instances across regions/zones and distribute using Global Load Balancing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>GKE</td>
<td>Multi-Master, Regional Clusters with pod and cluster autoscaling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Managed Services</td>
<td>Use managed services like App Engine, Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage, Cloud Filestore, Cloud Datastore, BigQuery</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Persistent Disks</td>
<td>Live Resizing improves availability

Use regional persistent disks</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cloud Bigtable</td>
<td>Place clusters in different zones or regions (Each cluster belong to a zone and you can create multiple clusters for high availability in the same instance)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cloud Datastore</td>
<td>Use Multi- Region locations</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cloud SQL</td>
<td>Use HA Configuration (regional)- clusters with primary instance and a standby instance is created.

Read replicas will NOT be promoted (So Read Replicas do NOT increase availability for Cloud SQL)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Network Tier</td>
<td>Prefer premium Network Tier to standard network tier</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hybrid Network Connecivity</td>
<td>Speed and Availability: Dedicated Interconnect > Partner Interconnect > VPN

Have a backup Connection

Example: VPN can be a backup for dedicated interconnect or have multiple Dedicated interconnect connections.</td>
