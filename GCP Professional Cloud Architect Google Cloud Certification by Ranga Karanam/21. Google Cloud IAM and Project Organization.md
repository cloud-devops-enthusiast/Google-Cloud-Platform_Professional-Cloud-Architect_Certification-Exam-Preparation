**Google Cloud IAM and Project Organization**

**Google Cloud Resources- Projects, Folders, and Organizations**

- Well Defined hierarchy:
  - *Organization > Folder > Project > Resources*
- Resources are created in a projects.
- A folder can multiple projects.
- Organization can contain multiple folders.

**Resource Hierarchy- Recommendations for Enterprises**

- Create separate projects for different environments (Dev, Test, Prod).
  - Complete isolation between environments like dev and prod.
- Create seperate folders for each department:
  - Isolate production applications for one department from another
  - You want to create a shared folder for shared resources
- One project per application per environment:
  - Let's consider two apps: "App1" and "App2"
  - Let's assume we need two environments: "Dev" and "Prod"
- In the ideal world you will create four projects:
  - A1-DEV, A1-PROD, A2-DEV, A2-PROD:
    - Isolates environments from each other
    - DEV changes will NOT break PROD
    - Grant all developers complete access (Create, Delete, Deploy) to DEV projects
    - Allow production access only to the operations teams

**Billing Accounts**

- Billing account is mandatory for creating resources in a project.
  - Billing account contains the payment details
  - Every project with active resources must be associated with a billing account
- Billing account can be associated with one or more projects
- You can have multiple billing accounts in an organization
- (Recommended) Create billing accounts representing your organization structure:
  - A startup can have just one billing account
  - A large enterprise can have a separate billing account for each department
- Two Types:
  - *Self Serve:* Billing directly to Credit Card or Bank Account
  - *Invoiced*: Generate invoices (Used by large enterprises)
