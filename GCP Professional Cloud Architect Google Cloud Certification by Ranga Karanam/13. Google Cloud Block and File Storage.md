**Google Cloud Block and File Storage**

**Storage Options**

- Block Storage and File Storage
- Block Storage: The type of storage of your hard disk.
- File Storage: A file share to share a set of files with your collegues in an enterprise.

**Block Storage**

- Typically, one block storage device can be connected to one virtual server.
- (Exceptions) You can attach read only block devices with multiple virtual servers and *certain cloud providers are exploring multi-writer disks as well*.
- However, you can attach multiple different block storage devices to a single virtual server.
- This can be used as:
  - Direct-attached storage (DAS)- Similar to a hard disk.
  - Storage area network (SAN)- High-speed network connecting a pool of storage devices. Example: Oracle and Microsoft SQL server

**File Storage**

- Media workflow need huge shared storage for supporting processes like video editing, audio editing, and 3D rendering.
- Enterprise users need a quick way to share files in a secure and organized way.
- These file shares are shared by multiple virtual servers.

**GCP- Block and File Storage**

- Block Storage
  - Persistent Disk: Network Block Storage
    - Zonal: Data replicated in one zone
    - Regional: Data replicated in multiple zones (Recommended for data loads with high durability requirements)
  - Local SSDs: Local block storage (These are present on the same host as the virtual machine and local to that)
- File Storage
  - Filestore: High performance file storage
- Whenever you boot an instance, there is a boot disk attached to it by default, which is a balanced persistent disk.
- if you want to have more disks attached to the instance, you can do that as well by going to the disks section and adding a new disk or an existing disk.
- Filestore: An instance is a fully managed network-attached storage system you can use with your google compute engine and kubernetes engine instances. There are two types in the firestore named as basic and high scale and even you can choose between HDD and SSD. You also have option to choose where to store your data based on regions and zones. Once your firestore is ready you need to ssh into your VM instance and mount the firestore to your VM instance. You can also mount the firestore to your kubernetes engine instance.


**GCP- Block Storage**

- Two popular types of block storage can be attached to VM instances are: Local SSDs and Persistent Disks.
- *Local SSDs* are physically attached to the host of the VM instance. Typically, they are used for temporary storage, such as scratch space for a build process or a database cache and the lifecycle of the data is tied to the lifecycle of the VM instance.
- *Persistent Disks* are network attached block storage devices that can be attached to multiple VM instances. They are used for persistent data storage, such as a database or a file share. The lifecycle of the data is independent of the VM instance. They are more durable.
- *Local SSDs*:
  - Phycially attached to the host of the VM instance.
    - Provides very high (IOPS) and very low latency.
    - (BUT) Ephemeral Storage- Temporary data (Data persists only until the VM instance is running)
      - Enable live migration for data to survive maintainance events.
    - Data is automatically encrypted, however you cannot configure encryption keys.
    - Lifecycle tied to the VM instance.
    - Only some machine types support local SSDs.
    - Supports SCSI and NVMe interfaces.
  - Remember: Choose NVMe-enabled and multi-queue SCSI images for best performance.
  - Larger local SSDs (more storage), More vCPUs (attached to VM)=> Even better performance.
  - Advantages:
    - Very fast I/O(~10-100x compared to persistent disks)
      - Higher throughput and lower latency.
    - Ideal for use cases needing high IOPs while storing temporary data.
      - Examples: Caches, Temporary Data, Scratch files, etc.
  - Disadvantages:
    - Ephemeral storage.
      - Lower durability, lower availability, lower flexibility compared to Persistent Disks.
