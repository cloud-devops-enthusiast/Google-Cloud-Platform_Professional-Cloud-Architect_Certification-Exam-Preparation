**Google Cloud Compliance and Regulations**

- Google cloud platform is compliant with several important certifications/regulations/standards:
  - ISO/IEC 27001 (Security controls that can help manage information risks).
  - ISO/IEC 27017 (Information security controls applicable to the provision and use of cloud services)
  - ISO/IEC 27018 (Critical components of cloud privacy - personally identifiable information (PII))
  - ISO/IEC 27701 (global privacy standard)
  - PCI DSS- Payment card industry (PCI) Data security standards (DSS)
  - SOC 1 (Auditing standard- How well does the vendor keep their books?)
  - SOC 2 (Assesment of service provider controls - Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy)
  - COPPA: Children's Online privacy protection act of 1998
    - Special requirements on websites created for children under the age of 13
  - HIPAA: Health Insurance Potability and Accountability act of 1996.
    - Data privacy and security requirements for Organizations handelling protected health information (PHI)
  - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Strengthens personal data protection in europe.
  - Customers are responsible for ensuring that their applications are compliant with certifications/regulations/standards.

**HIPAA**

- HIPAA Compliance is a shared responsibility:
  - GCP supports HIPAA compliance
  - But customers are responsible for evaluating HIPAA Compliance
- Execute a Google Cloud Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
  - You can request a BAA directly from your account manager
    - HIPAA BAA covers GCP's entire infrastructure (across all regions)
      - Multi-regional service redundancy including usage of Preemptible VMs
    - Do not use Google Cloud Products not covered by BAA
- Recommended Best Practices:
  - Follow IAM best practices
  - Consider enabling Object Versioning on Cloud Storage Buckets.
  - Recommended: Export audit logs to Cloud Storage (archival) and BigQuery (analytics)
  - Disable request caching of PHI in Cloud CDN

**PCI Data Security Standards(DSS)**

- Payment Card Industry DSS: Requirements to enhance card-holder security.
- Best Practices and Recommendations:
  - Create a new Google Cloud account for your payment processing environment
    - Isolate from other environments
  - Restrict access to payment processing environment
    - Follow "principle of least privilege"
  - Control inbound and outbound traffic
    - Creating firewall rules to allow ONLY following inbound traffic
      - HTTPS requests from customers
      - Responses from third party payment processor
      - Office network - for auditing and management
    - Only allow outbound traffic (HTTPS) to third-party payment processor
      - Compute engine and GKE are recommended compute services (App Engine, Cloud Functions do NOT support egress firewall rules)
- Create an HTTPS load balancer with signed SSL certificate.
- Create hardened secure Linux image with the minimum software needed to run your app.
- Automated most of the processes:
  - Deploy using cloud deployment manager
  - Configuration management using Chef, Puppet, Ansible or Salt
  - Build an automated recovery plan
- Implement Forseti Security: Open-Source tools to improve security of GCP environments:
  - Inventory: Compare your Google Cloud resources (inventory) over time.
  - Scanner: Compare role-based access policies over time
  - Enforcer: Compare firewall rules with a specified state
  - Explain: Provides visibility into your IAM policies
- Enable VPC flow logs, Access transparency logs, Firewall rules logging and Configure monitoring alerts.
  - Stream audit logs to cloud storage and use bucket locks to make logs immutable
  - Streaming audit logs to BigQuery for analysis
- Using cloud data loss prevention to sanitize data:
  - Grant apps access to PCI data only after it has been sanitized with cloud data loss prevention.
