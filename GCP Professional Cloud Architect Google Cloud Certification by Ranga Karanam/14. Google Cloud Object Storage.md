**Google Cloud Object Storage**

- The name of bucket is globally unique and a permanent name.
- While choosing where to store your data, you can select the location where you want to store your data.
  - These permanent choices defines the geographic placement of your data and affects the cost, performance, and availability of your data.
    - LocatioN Types:
      - Regional : Lowest latency within a single region.
      - Dual-Region : High-availability and low latency across two regions.
      - Multi-Region : Highest availability across largest area.
- Choosing a default storage class for your data:
  - Standard : Best for short-term storage and frequently accessed data.
  - Nearline : Best for backups and data accessed less than once a month.
  - Coldline : Best for disaster recovery and data accessed less than once a quarter.
  - Archive : Best for long term digital preservation of data accessed less than once a year.
- Choosing how to control access to objects:
  - Fine-grained access control : Specify access to individual objects by using object-level permissions and access control lists (ACLs) in addition to bucket-level permissions(IAM).
  - Uniform access control : Ensure uniform access to all objects in the bucket by using only bucket level permissions(IAM). This option becomes permanent after 90 days.
- Now you can create your bucket.

**Cloud Storage**

- Most popular, very flexible and inexpensive storage service.
  - Serverless: Autoscaling and Infinite storage.
- Storage large objects as using a key-value approach:
  - Treats entire object as a unit (partial updates are not allowed).
    - Recommended when you operate on entire object most of the time.
    - Access control at object level.
  - Also called Object Storage. You're using every single file as an object and treating that whole file as a singke unit.
- Provides REST api to access and modify the objects.
  - Provides CLI (gsutil) to access and modify the objects and client libraries for many languages like C++, C#, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python and Ruby.
- *Store all file types*: Text, binary, backup and archives:
  - Media files and archives, Application packages and logs.
  - Backups of your databases or storage devices.
  - Staging data during on-premise to cloud database migration.
