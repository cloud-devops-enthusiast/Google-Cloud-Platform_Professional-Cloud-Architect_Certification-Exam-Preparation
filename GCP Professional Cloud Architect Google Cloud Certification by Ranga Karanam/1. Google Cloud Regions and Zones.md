* **Regions and Zones**
There are multiple regions and zones for providing low latency and high speed services.

Region: Specific Geographic locations to host your resources.

Advantage: High availability, Low latency, Global footprint, Adhere to government regulations

Zones: The technique to achieve high availability in the same region. Zones in a single region are connected through low-latency links.

Advantage: Increased availability and fault tolerance within the same region. Each zone has one or more discrete clusters, where Clusterâ€™s are the distinct physical infrastructure that is housed in a data-center.
